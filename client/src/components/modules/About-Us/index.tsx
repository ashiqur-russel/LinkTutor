              With LinkTutor, we create a tutoring space where each student's

              Because every student thinks and understands things differently.
              And thatâ€™s a good thing! These different ways of thinking lead to
              new ideas, alternative approaches, and questions that are
              important for shaping our future.

              In today's school system, one teacher teaches up to 30 students,
              which means individual needs and personal thought patterns cannot
              be adequately supported.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We want to support students in clarifying their individual
              questions and problems and thus reducing deficits so that each
              student can develop their unique potential.
